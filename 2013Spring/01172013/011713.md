# Lab Meeting: 17 January 2013 

Regrets: Stephen, Matt 

Welcome back! 

(Note: this meeting is the first where we are documenting in this fashion (using markdown and GitHub). However, see the 2012Fall subdirectory for screengrabs from our meetings in Fall 2012, when the lab opened its doors.) 

The lab also wants to welcome Laura, who --- this week --- is joining us for the semester.

Question: 

## Jentery

* The library is growing; feel free to borrow a book; just leave your name, the date, and the title on the checkout list.

* On the tack board, I also posted a list of our various accounts. 

* Next Thursday (here, 3-4pm), Jana is conducting [a workshop on how to data model an object](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/helloWorldWorkshops/blob/master/posters/millarusiskin.pdf). Please attend!

* In your logs, please publish the most recent entry at the top, not the bottom, of your Google Doc. Thanks! 

* I've archived [your logs on GitHub](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/logs); this way, they are accessible by all in the future; of note, the repo is private. 

* We're also using GitHub for other projects, including the website, the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit, and various makerspace and MVP projects.   

* When you have a second, mind starting a GitHub account and following [me](https://github.com/jentery)? Then I can add you to various MLab repos.  

* What other things should we push to GitHub? Recommendations? What would make your work easier? 

* The website should go live by January's end; Mikka, Arthur, and I will be contacting you with some revision requests; also, start planning your next post :)
