## Katie 

Thinking through visualizations: how can they mean things without giving the impression that they "close off" meaning? 

In terms of pedagogy, for instance: how to show students visualization as a lens or launchpad for the text? 

Stephen: compare a visualization of the text (e.g., a word cloud) with the text.

Shaun: need to making "meaningful visualizations." 

Katie: could you embed visualization mechanisms into a text / article to which people could contribute?

All of the AAB images are in ContentDM now, but they cannot be embedded in Scalar.  

How to slurp "impages" from ContentDM into a Scalar exhibit?

Looking at intersections between MA thesis on Arduino and the Croc Exhibit (in the context of DIY culture).  

What are the contexts for and histories of DIY? Is it historically contingent? Can you talk about DIY as a whole? If so, then what is it? 

How do locally or historically contingent categories relate to digital access of materials / goods online (e.g., an open-source Arduino micro-controller)?
