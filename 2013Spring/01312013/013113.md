# Lab Meeting: 31 January 2013 

Regrets: Amanda, Adam
 
# Presentations: 

## Katie 

Thinking through visualizations: how can they be meaningful without giving the impression that they "close off" meaning? 

In terms of pedagogy, for instance: how to teach students visualization as a lens or launchpad for the text? 

Stephen: compare a visualization of the text (e.g., a word cloud) with the text itself. 

Katie: could you embed visualization mechanisms into a text / article and have readers contribute data?

All of the AAB images are in CONTENTdm now, but they cannot be embedded in Scalar.  

How to slurp "impages" from CONTENTdm into a Scalar exhibit? How to build better hooks and bridges between the two platforms?

Looking at intersections between MA thesis on Arduino and the Croc Exhibit (in the context of DIY culture).  

What are the contexts for and histories of DIY? Is it historically contingent? Can you talk about DIY as a whole? If so, then what is it? 

How do historically contingent categories and definitions of DIY relate to digital access of materials / goods online (e.g., an open-source Arduino micro-controller)? 

## Mikka

Has enjoyed reading and reviewing everyone's work and writing (on the Maker site). What to do about technical terminology, tho? How can DH terms alienate readers? How do terms act as barriers of entry? For the site, transparency and definitions will be important. 

Also, length: tl;dr. What do we make of tendency to want shorter materials / content online? 

Adèle: risk of bouncing or skipping across sites. Need to define terms. Thanks for the comments, Mikka! 

Arthur: audience is important here, too. How is / can the site (e.g., through design) be community-oriented? Is the design brushing against the content? How can the content be more audience-friendly? 

## Adèle

Working on visualizing versions of M. Moore's "Poetry." Investigated [Timeline.js](http://timeline.verite.co/) and [Voyant](http://voyeurtools.org/). They don't quite fit her needs for this specific project.  

Is anyone familiar with data viz of poetry? Pedagogically, is rendering poetry through graphical expression productive of meaningful interpretations? How does the viz of prose differ? 

Some visualizations of time (e.g., telos or chronos) may not work for Moore, who did not see change / difference as evolution.  

Shaun: see [this](http://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/clifford_sweet_old_etcetera/sweetweb/sweetoldetc.html)? 

Adèle: also looking at [Daniel's work](https://vimeo.com/57707614) with jQuery.     

## Alex

Three things: first, how to visualize correspondences between stress points of a novel (e.g., by Proust)? Also, does a reversion count as a change? As a variant? Elsewhere, considering use of Git and GitHub for OCR corrections. How could revision control enhance the quality and process of OCR? Finally, when documenting process and information flow, what should we share? Not sure at this point. How to make those decisions? 

## Jentery

Enjoyed giving a talk for TS 400 this week. How to do more outreach of that sort? 

## Stephen

Katie solved dirty TP (of *Nostromo*). Now we almost have two OCR-corrected versions of the novel. 

Also, charting all activities of the MVP, with milestones and such. Gantt chart acts as a snapshot of where we are, and where we are going (or should be going). This will be important for communicating with the board.    

## Matt 

Continue versioning of *Ulysses*. Found some interesting diffs from *Little Review* and *Shakespeare & Co.* Later discovered that the difference was "hand-versioned" in earlier scholarship. But how could DH tools extend or enhance this scholarship? Switching texts, moving away from Joyce to Wells (*Tono-Bungay*)? 

Stephen: does the instance of a "hand-versioned" text mean we shouldn't still pursue the inquiry through digital / electronic means? 

## Arthur

Working on videos of the DHSI workshops as well as the first zine issue (which will be a collaborative doc).
